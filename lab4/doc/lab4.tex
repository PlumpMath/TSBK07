\section{Lab 4}
\subsection{Load and inspect the heightmap}
\subsubsection{What kind of data does the heightmap image data hold? What range is the heightmap data?}
It contains integers between 0 and 255.

\subsubsection{The terrain is 4x4. How many polygons does it draw?}
It paints 18 triangles, one polygon.


\subsection{Navigating the heightmap}
\subsubsection{Did you need to extend your camera movement code? How?}
Yes, we made it actually work.

\subsection{Calculate normal vectors and apply lighting}
\subsubsection{How did you implement the cross product? Function call, inline...? Normalization? }
We calculated two vectors in each polygon and took the cross product between them and normalized the normal. We used the crossproduct provided in VectorUtils3.

\subsubsection{Which method did you use to find the normal vector?}
We used the above described method.
