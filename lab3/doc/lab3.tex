\section{Lab 3}
\subsection{Hierarcical modelling, the windmill}
\subsubsection{How can you get all four blades to rotate with just one time-dependent rotation matrix?}
Using the magic of M\_PI.

$
		mat4 rotBlade = Mult(Rz(M_PI / 2 * i + t), Ry(M_PI / 2));
$

\subsubsection{How do you make the wings follow the body's movements?}
We constructed the translation matrix of the wings by adding the translation matrix of the walls to a new matrix. Though MatrixAdd is working out very oddly for us.

\subsubsection{You may have to tweak some numbers to make the placement right. How can you do that without making a lot of small changes in numbers in the code followed by recompilations?}

In main we first run InitKeymapManager() and then in our update loop we have the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}
	if(keyIsDown('w'))
		y += 0.1;
	else if (keyIsDown('s'))
		y -= 0.1;
	if(keyIsDown('a'))
		x -= 0.1;
	else if(keyIsDown('d'))
		x += 0.1;
	if(keyIsDown('q'))
		z += 0.1;
	else if(keyIsDown('e'))
		z -= 0.1;

	if (keyIsDown('p'))
		printf("%f %f %f \n", x, y, z);

	transBlade = T(x, y, z);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Manual viewing controls}
\subsubsection{What kind of control did you implement?}
We implemented a rotation around the object based on the X-axis of the
mouse. Moving the mouse in the Y-axis moves the camera along the
Y-axis of the world. In practice we implemented cylindrical
coordinates.

\subsubsection{Can you make this kind of control in some other way
  than manipulating a "look-at" matrix?}
Probably, reasonably, yes. We could move every object in the world instead.
